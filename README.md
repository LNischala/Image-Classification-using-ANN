# Image Classification using ANN & CNN

## Overview
This project implements both **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** and **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** models for image classification using the **CIFAR-10 Dataset**. The models are trained to classify images into 10 categories, including airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.

## Features
- ðŸ–¼ **Image Classification** â€“ Classifies images into 10 predefined categories.
- ðŸ¤– **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** â€“ Implements a basic deep learning model for classification.
- ðŸ§  **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** â€“ Enhances feature extraction for improved accuracy.
- ðŸ“Š **Data Preprocessing** â€“ Normalizes and augments images for better training performance.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Dataset:** CIFAR-10 Dataset

## Usage
- Load and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- Train the **ANN model** and evaluate its performance.
- Train the **CNN model** for improved classification accuracy.
- Compare results between ANN and CNN models.
